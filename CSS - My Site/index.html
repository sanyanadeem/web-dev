        <h3>Web Development.</h3>
        <p>I enjoy coding and have developed many sites, such as this one. You can find links to all my sites below.</p>
        <p>My brother taught me how to create websites (like this), and after learning this skill, I like to keep adding content to projects.</p>

        <h3>Teaching.</h3>
        <p>I really like teaching, because it is something that helps so many people. Also, 100% of proceeds go to my favorite charity, so it's a win-win!</p>
        <p>To register, email me and I'll let you know the details. A virtual classroom will be here soon!</p>
