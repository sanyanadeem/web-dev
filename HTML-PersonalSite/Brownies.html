  <h1>How to Bake Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate Chip Brownies:</h1>
  <img src="alreadyEatenBrownieILoveit.jpg" alt="My Brownies">
  <p><em><strong>An original recipe</strong> from Sanya Nadeem.</em></p>
  <p>Yum! Just thinking about these brownies makes me lick my lips. These brownies
    are made from a mix by a decadent chocolate company--yep, you guessed it,
    Ghirardelli! These brownies have three types of chocolate chips in them, so
    you can keep getting that fudgy goodness in each bite! Savor this brownie, and
    serve with cool vanilla ice cream, caramel syrup, or without any topping at all!
    No matter which way you eat these desserts, you'll for sure find yourself making
    these over and over again! </p>
