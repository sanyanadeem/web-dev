  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl, set aside. Whisk
      the eggs and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup with a spout, set aside.
      Lightly brush a 9 by 5 by 3-inch loaf pan with butter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. </li>
    <br>
    <li>n a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric
      hand-held mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually
      pour the egg mixture into the butter while mixing until incorporated. Add
      the bananas (the mixture will appear to be curdled, so don't worry), and
      remove the bowl from the mixer. </li>
    <br>
    <li>With a rubber spatula, mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated.
      Fold in the nuts and transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for 55
      minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes
      out clean. Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Turn
      the bread out of the pan and let cool completely on the rack. Wrap in plastic
      wrap. The banana bread is best if served the next day. Serve and enjoy! </li>
