  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. </li>
    <br>
    <li>For the crust: In a food processor, combine the confectioners' sugar,
      flour, and butter, and process until the mixture forms a ball. With your
      fingers, press the dough into a 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom,
      taking care to push the crust into the indentations in the sides. Pat
      until the crust is even. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until very lightly
      browned. Set aside to cool.</li>
    <br>
    <li>For the filling and topping: Beat the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla
      together until smooth. Spread over the cooled crust. Cut the strawberries
      into 1/4-inch slices and arrange around the edge of the crust. For the next
      circle, use kiwi slices. Add another circle of strawberries, filling in any
      spaces with blueberries. Cluster the raspberries in the center of the tart.</li>
    <br>
    <li>For the glaze: Combine the limeade, cornstarch, lime juice, and sugar in a
      small saucepan and cook over medium heat until clear and thick, about 2 minutes.
      Let cool. With a pastry brush, glaze the entire tart. You will not use all
      of the glaze.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Keep the tart in the refrigerator. Remove about 15 minutes before serving.
      Slice into 8 wedges and serve with a dollop of whipped cream. Now, get
      ready to bite into the most fresh and delicious dessert you have ever had!
